Instead we will simply normalize all images by dividing by 255.\n","- Perform image augmentation using the Albumentations library.

For validation I've used a simple train/test split. However, because the dataset is so small using 5 or 10 fold cross validation is a wiser validation strategy. It will provide a better estimate of the model's quality. This is just a starter kernel so I will leave this for you to experiment with.\n","\n","2. I've defined an image augmentation setup below. If you display some of the augmented images they may look strange. It's easy to think that these images will confuse the model during training - this is what I thought at first. However, even though the augmented images may look a bit crazy, this approach actually works."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":81},"colab_type":"code","id":"oKqdE0tnnD5W","outputId":"bc44bafc-dfb8-4dbb-9fa6-11978429aefd","trusted":false},"outputs":[{"ename":"ModuleNotFoundError","evalue":"No
